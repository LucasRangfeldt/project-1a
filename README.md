# Heaven's Restaurant

Heaven's Restaurant is a business which has one primary goal, make customers happy. This is however a made-up business with no real activity.

## User Experience

### User Stories

1. As a user, I want to be able to navigate the business on first look.
2. As a user, I want to be able to contact the business without having to go through a bunch of channels.
3. As a user, I want to be able to quickly get redirected to new sites that the current site refers to.

### Design

### Colour Scheme

#a9927d antiquewhite; #49111a 
I wanted a silent but also a bit of colorization, hence the colors.

## Typography 

Nanum Myeongjo is the main font of the site, reserve is sans-serif. Easy to read, with a little bit of style aswell.

Montserrat is the font used for certain areas where I felt Manum Myeongjo didn't fit in.

## Features

When first entered site, you can choose between 4 options, clicking any of the nav links will redirect you to different sections of the page.

## Contact

The contact button in the nav bar will scroll you down to a form, in this form you are required to fill out your details in order to send a message, the message will be directly forwarded to the owners Email.

## Menu

The menu button in the nav bar will scroll you down to the menu section, since the company hasn't really gotten used to this whole coding experience yet its still a work in progress.

## Home

The home button in the nav bar is just a link to the main page.

## About

The about button will scroll you down to the about section, where there are a few photos and some nicely composed texts.

## Footer

In the footer you can see the owners copyright signature, as well as links to external sites.

## testing

## Credits

W3Schools has helped me through most of the sections, the general styling and making sure that everything is just right.

![https://github.com/AmyOShea/Angies-Beauty-MS1] Amy's work was a great influence too, followed certain guidelines I saw she used, her result was way better, though.

My Mentor Antonio gave me a lot of solid advice.

My Personal Chat Ai, who came up with most of the text that sits on the site. (Made up, not taken.)
